DATASET: Primary school temporal network data
Release data: Sep 30, 2015

This data set contains the temporal network of contacts between the
children and teachers used in the study published in BMC Infectious
Diseases 2014, 14:695.  The file contains a tab-separated list
representing the active contacts during 20-second intervals of the
data collection. Each line has the form “t i j Ci Cj”, where i and j
are the anonymous IDs of the persons in contact, Ci and Cj are their
classes, and the interval during which this contact was active is [ t
– 20s, t ]. If multiple contacts are active in a given interval, you
will see multiple lines starting with the same value of t.  Time is
measured in seconds.  Terms and conditions
